Live or Leave finds the houses and apartments for rent that surround you and matches you with the ones that fit your personal preferences.

Live or Leave features all homes to rent which are on ImmobilienScout24, so you can choose from the best homes on Germanyâ€™s market leading property portal.

Once you are matched with a home, you can view all the details and contact the realtor directly through ImmobilienScout24. Or you can also keep swiping to find your next match!

Live or Leave has been developed by ImmobilienScout24 engineers during HackDays 2017.
