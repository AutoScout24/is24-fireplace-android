### Hackdays: Fireplace (Tinder for Real Estate)

The idea is to provide our users with a tool which allows a quick playful solution to look at properties in the area you are located in that very moment.

Like Tinder it would only show the main photo of the listing alongside with some key data.

By defining a few preferences like number of rooms and maximum rent the app shows only listings that match my needs...

The liked ones (swiped to the right) will be saved and can ideally be seen in the myscout profile on the desktop....
